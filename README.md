# Python-FirstOne
Created out of boredom, a piece of code for inputting new data into excel... meant for IB lab reports raw data measurements.
Current features:
  Logging
  Reading an excel file
  Ask for user for raw data
  Save to new excel file, iteration of the old one

Planned features:
  Fully fledged version control of excel file
  Better logging
  File generation
    Create xlsx file
    Ask user for control groups
    -"- experimental groups
    -"- independent variable
    -"- dependent variable(s)
    -"- controlled variables
    generate tables of data for independent variable
    generate tables for change in dependent variable(s)
  Automatic sharing with project members by email or just giving links to xlsx file
